# Fall detector by STwinbox

## Project Overview
This project, was developed as part of an academic research initiative at the University of Trento. It explores the use of the STEVAL-STWINBX1 (STwinbox) low-power microcontroller for real-time fall detection through embedded artificial intelligence.
The goal was to design a system capable of recognizing impacts or falls such as those involving elderly individuals combining data from onboard sensors with a lightweight AI model optimized for tinyML deployment. The project includes the complete pipeline: data acquisition, preprocessing, signal correction, feature extraction, and neural network training, all designed to run efficiently on a constrained embedded platform. 
The repository provides the main Python scripts for data conversion and correction, as well as references to the trained model implemented through Edge Impulse. All information regarding the entire research is available in the PDF report included in the files. In addition, the developed part of the AI mentioned in the report is available at the following link:

##  Data Conversion and Correction Script

The Python script "Dat_Reader_Corrector" automates the process of:
1. **Reading and converting** binary `.dat` files from STMicroelectronics sensors (accelerometers, microphones, magnetometers, etc.) into human-readable `.csv` format;  
2. **Applying correction data** from matching files (`.csv` or `.dat`) located in a correction folder;  
3. **Saving the corrected results** in an output folder.

In short:  
➡️ **Input:** raw `.dat` files  
➡️ **Output:** corrected `.csv` files in physical units (m/s², Pa, mG, etc.)

###  Folder Structure

Make sure your folders are organized as follows:

```
📂 Desktop
 ┣ 📂 Base files       # folder containing the original .dat files
 ┣ 📂 Corrector        # folder containing correction files (.csv or .dat)
 ┗ 📂 Results          # folder where corrected CSVs will be saved
```

---

###  How It Works

For each `.dat` file in the input folder, the script performs the following steps:

1. **File Parsing**
   - Each sensor type (`iis2dlpc_acc.dat`, `iis3dwb_acc.dat`, `iis2iclx_acc.dat`, `imp23absu_mic.dat`, `iis2mdc_mag.dat`),
    corresponding respectively to accelerometer_2D, accelerometer_3D, accelerometer_6Axies, microphone and magnetometer is handled with its specific:
     - Sampling rate;
     - Sensitivity coefficient ([g] or [Pa] per [LSB]);
     - Conversion from raw data to physical units ([m/s²], [Pa], [mG]);
     - Filterinf process that remove unrealistic or saturated values.

3. **Correction Application**
   - The script looks for a correction file in the `correction_folder`:
     - If it finds a `.csv` or `.dat` file, with the same name as the sensors that must be converted, it **subtracts** the correction vectors (X, Y, Z) from the original data.
     - It automatically recognizes equivalent column names (e.g. `accX`, `AccX`, `X_g`, etc.).
     - If no compatible correction is found, the original data are kept unchanged.

4. **Data Export**
   - The corrected data are saved as `.csv` in the `output_folder`, keeping the same filename as the original `.dat`.

###  Dependencies

The script only relies on standard Python libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas
```

---

###  Execution

1. Edit the folder paths at the beginning of the script:

```python
input_folder = r"C:\Users\...\Base Files"
output_folder = r"C:\Users\...\Results"
correction_folder = r"C:\Users\...\Corrector"
```

2. Run the script from your terminal or IDE:

```bash
python Dat_Reader_Corrector.py
```

3. Check the output folder for the converted and corrected `.csv` files.

###  Supported Sensors

| File | Sensor | Sampling rate | Conversion | Final units |
|------|---------|----------------|-------------|--------------|
| `iis2dlpc_acc.dat` | Low-power accelerometer | 50 Hz | raw → g → m/s² | m/s² |
| `iis3dwb_acc.dat` | Wideband accelerometer | 26.8 kHz | raw → g → m/s² | m/s² |
| `iis2iclx_acc.dat` | Inclinometer accelerometer | 835 Hz | raw → g → m/s² | m/s² |
| `imp23absu_mic.dat` | Microphone | 16 kHz | raw → Pa | Pa |
| `iis2mdc_mag.dat` | Magnetometer | 101.91 Hz | raw → mG | mG |

---

###  Additional Notes

- `.dat` files are interpreted as 16-bit integer arrays (`int16`, `<i2`).
- Conversion coefficients follow **official STMicroelectronics sensitivity constants**.
- Unrealistic peaks or saturation values are automatically set to zero.
- If no correction file is found, a message is printed and the original data are used.

###  Example Output

Example of a converted accelerometer CSV:

```csv
time,accX,accY,accZ
0.0000,-0.0117,0.0089,9.8123
0.0200,-0.0118,0.0087,9.8130
...
```
